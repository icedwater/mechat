# WeChat API

Messing around with the WeChat API. Looks like a good excuse to try Android
programming as well, and eventually iOS programming, though it'll have to be
done without XCode...?

Download the [iOS SDK][i_sdk] and [sample code][i_smp] or [Android SDK][a_sdk]
and [sample code][a_smp] here.
